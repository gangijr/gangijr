    <p>
      If I were in charge of this course I would not change much in terms of the
      pace or amount of work, as I think knowing I was alwaysing going to be
      learning something new forced me to learn quicker. But, I do wish that the
      readings were a bit more clear as it was hard to follow at times looking
      from one code snippet to the next. And it would have been helpful if there
      was a comprehensive repository at the end of the reading. I know this
      opens the possibility for people to just copy and paste for the readings,
      but for those of us who read and are still confused, it would have been
      helpful. The same can be said for labs. I get that we should be figuring
      out how to complete the labs on our own but it would have been nice to see
      the correct way to complete the lab, so that we can reference the logic
      for future projects. But, as far as the content of the course I couldn't
      be happier. I went into this course hoping to learn about HTML, CSS, JS,
      and React. And now I am happy to say that this course has given me a great
      base of each technology for me to build off of in the future.
