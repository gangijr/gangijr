          This week I have chosen to write about maps.
          Maps are images can be clicked and dragged on top of in order to navigate around the image.
          You can also embed hyperlinks (and much more) within the map so that the user can click and interact.
          Here is a link to the repository <a href="https://github.com/gangijr/gangijr/blob/master/index.html">here</a>.

  <h3 id="village">The Village</h3>
  <img src=https://www.jmu.edu/_images/orl/halls/chappelear.jpeg alt="village_pic" style="width:1000px;height:600px;">
  <p>The village is a collection of dormitories in the middle of campus right next to bookstore, Mr.Chips, and many basketball courts.
      I spent a lot time here as a freshman as I lived in Ikenberry hall. I also walk through the village (along with many other students) while going main or east campus.
      The village includes :  Chappelear Hall, Dingledine Hall, Frederikson Hall, Garber Hall, Hanson Hall, Huffman Hall, Ikenberry Hall, Weaver Hall, and White Hall.

  <h3 id="quad">The Quad</h3>

  <p>Located in the middle of main campus, the quad is a large walkable field that is surrounded by dormitories and classrooms alike. 
      It is also the main spot that people hang out in while the weather is nice.The iconic James Madison University quad looks very much as the designers, 
      first president Julian Burruss and architect Charles Robinson, intended when they designed the campus for the State Normal and Industrial School for Women at Harrisonburg in 1908.
      An expanse of aesthetically-pleasing lawn surrounded by symmetrically arranged buildings was meant to convey an atmosphere of dignified order, while the enclosed layout would promote the idea that young women enrolled in the Normal School would be protected from the influences of the outside world.
      The Greco-Roman details of the buildings represented democratic and scholarly ideals, and the blue limestone from which they were built was a testament to the schoolâ€™s self-sufficiency and resourcefulness, as it was quarried directly from the building site.

  <h3 id="greekRow">Greek Row</h3>

  <p>Greek Row is located next to Newman lake and has a nice veiw of Bridgeforth and the College of Business center.
      This is home to every soroity that JMU has to offer and even two fraternitys have houses there. Greek Row is a series of attached units completed in 1978 and originally built for fraternity and sorority housing. 
      The facility was expanded in 1987, and includes the "tree" residence halls.

  <h3 id="ISAT">ISAT</h3>
  <img src=https://www.jmu.edu/bsisat/images/banners/isat-bldg.jpg alt="isat_pic" style="width:1000px;height:600px;">
  <p>ISAT is where all of the smart kids on campus come to go to class. Just kidding but this is home to 
      Engineering, Computer Science, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and many more I am sure that I am forgetting. 
      This is also where I have all my clases.

  <h3 id="UREC">UREC</h3>
  <img src=https://www.jmu.edu/_images/recreation/cover-photos/urec-front.jpeg alt="urec_pic" style="width:1000px;height:500px;">
  <p>This is the University Recreation Center, commonly refered to as UREC. It houses by far the nicest gym in Harrisonburg,
      and it is where you can always find students trying to impove themsevles physically there. No, really its open from 6am to 1130pm and its almost 
      always packed.

  <h3 id="ECL">Rose Library (ECL)</h3>
  <img src=https://www.jmu.edu/_images/stories/rose-library-1200-655x393.jpg alt="rose_pic" style="width:1000px;height:600px;">
  <p>Rose Library (otherwise known as the East Campus Library) is the nices building on east campus and houses and amazing library filled
      with book, study rooms, and computer labs. If you go there know that each level has its own level of acceptable noise (it gets quiter the higher the floor).
      It is also in my opinion the best place to get work done if you need to 'lock in'.
