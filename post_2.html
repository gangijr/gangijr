        This week I decided I wanted to check out CSS animations, as in class we were beginning to work with CSS styling.
        At first I found a simple example of a block moving about the screen and changing color. While that was intersting to look into
        it just was not quite the type of animation that I had in mind. So after some searching around I found examples of typing animation
        using HTML, CSS, and JS. However because I am not quite the best with JS yet I decided to stick with simple HTML and CSS. So if you were 
        paying attention when the page loaded the title of this post typed itself out! If you missed it don't worry, just refresh and pay attention to
        the left side of the screen!
